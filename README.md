# Low-light-Image-Enhancemet
Implementing the Zero-Refernce Deep Curve Estimation model for low light and improving it further by using Dark Channel Prior(DCP) of image.
The proposed method follows a spatial attention mechanism to emphasize appropriate regions.

a) is ground truth, b) is the image enhanced by original dcp model, c) is image enhanced by our model.
we can clearly see that our model enhances whiter/clouder region appropraitely compared to orginal model,  which overenhances the whiter region.
